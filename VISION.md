# Kingshot Tools - Long-Term Vision

## Mission Statement

Create the premier resource hub for the Kingshot community, providing alliance leaders and individual players with powerful coordination tools, helpful calculators, and a collaborative platform that helps them maximize their success in the game.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Accessibility First:** Core tools remain free and accessible to everyone. Players shouldn't need accounts or payments to access basic functionality.

**Community-Driven:** Build for both alliances AND individuals. Not everyone is an officer, but everyone needs tools and information.

**Progressive Enhancement:** Tools work great standalone, but become more powerful when integrated together.

**Value-Based Monetization:** Premium features should serve those who invest heavily in the game (time and money) and need advanced coordination.

---

---

## Major Problem Areas to Solve

### 1. Alliance Coordination Chaos
**The Problem:**
Alliance events require complex coordination across 50+ people over multiple days. Officers currently use scattered tools (Discord, spreadsheets, in-game chat) with no integration. Plans get lost, members miss instructions, and results suffer.

**Our Solution Direction:**
Unified alliance workspace where officers can plan events, track members, assign roles, and communicate - all in one place. Integration between planning tools (Castle Scheduler) and member data creates powerful workflows.

---

### 2. Member Performance Visibility
**The Problem:**
Alliance leaders struggle to answer basic questions:
- Who is actually participating in events?
- Who should we promote to officer or rally captain?
- Who hasn't been active and might need a check-in?
- How is our alliance growing compared to competitors?

Officers currently track this manually in spreadsheets (if at all), which is tedious and incomplete.

**Our Solution Direction:**
Simple tracking tools that officers can update during events. Focus on participation (who showed up) and progress (power growth, troop increases) rather than complex analytics. Make it easy to spot patterns without hours of data entry.

---

### 3. Event Preparation & Strategy
**The Problem:**
Events like Alliance Championship require specific preparation:
- Register with buffs active (they "snapshot" for entire event)
- Optimal lane distribution strategies
- Coordinating who focuses on which objectives
- Timing resource usage and troop training

Currently this knowledge lives in scattered Discord messages and veteran player heads.

**Our Solution Direction:**
Event-specific preparation checklists and planning tools. Templates based on proven strategies. Integration with calculators to help players prepare efficiently.

---

### 4. Individual Player Progression
**The Problem:**
Players want to optimize their growth but the game provides limited planning information:
- "Should I upgrade to Castle 25 now or train more troops?"
- "How many resources do I need for the next research level?"
- "What troop composition is optimal for my level?"

**Our Solution Direction:**
Comprehensive calculators and planning tools for individual progression. Material calculators, upgrade planners, cost estimators. Help players make informed decisions about time and money investment.

---

### 5. Knowledge Accessibility
**The Problem:**
Game mechanics are complex and poorly documented. New players struggle. Even veterans have questions. Information is scattered across wikis, YouTube videos, Discord servers.

**Our Solution Direction:**
Centralized, searchable information hub. Community-contributed guides. Integration of knowledge directly into tools (contextual help, tooltips, examples).

---

### 6. Battle Strategy & Coordination
**The Problem:**
Large-scale battles like KvK (Kingdom vs Kingdom), Castle sieges, and Outpost attacks require complex coordination:
- Who attacks which target and when?
- Rally timing and troop composition
- Defensive positioning and reinforcement planning
- Real-time adaptation as battles evolve

Currently, officers try to coordinate through voice chat, Discord messages, or hastily-drawn diagrams. Plans are hard to visualize and easily misunderstood.

**Our Solution Direction:**
Visual planning tools for attack strategies. Mark targets, assign attackers, plan timing. Similar approach to Territory Planner but focused on battle coordination. Community can share and discuss effective strategies, building collective knowledge through experimentation.

---

## Social Platform & Content Creation

### Philosophy: Community as Knowledge Engine
**We don't claim to have all the answers.** The platform creator is a player exploring the game alongside everyone else. Part of Kingshot's appeal is testing strategies, discovering what works, and sharing findings with others.

The best insights come from:
- Veterans who've tested strategies in hundreds of battles
- Alliance leaders who've tried different coordination approaches
- Individual players who've optimized specific aspects of gameplay
- The collective wisdom of experimentation and iteration

### Alliance Walls & Communication
**Alliance-Specific Spaces:**
- Alliance leaders post rules, expectations, and guidelines
- Officers share event strategies and preparation checklists
- Members discuss tactics and ask questions
- Privacy-controlled: Visible only to alliance members (default)
- Can optionally make posts public to share with broader community
- Commenting and discussion threads
- Pin important announcements to top

**Use Cases:**
- "Here's our Castle Battle strategy for this week" (with linked schedule)
- "Rally captain requirements: 30M+ power, T11 troops, available 18:00 UTC"
- "KvK prep checklist: Make sure you have speedups saved, buffs ready, troops trained"
- "Congratulations to [member] for reaching 50M power!"

### Player Profiles & Personal Walls
**Individual Spaces:**
- Players share their progression strategies
- Post about achievements and milestones
- Discuss troop compositions or research priorities
- Share calculator results: "Here's what I need for my next upgrade"
- Privacy controls: Public, friends-only, or private

**Use Cases:**
- "This F2P strategy got me to 40M power in 6 months"
- "Optimal troop composition for my current research level"
- "Should I upgrade Castle or focus on research? Here's my situation..."
- Build reputation as knowledgeable contributor

### Community Strategy Library
**Collective Knowledge Repository:**
- Players submit strategy guides and battle plans
- Community votes on most helpful content
- Filter by event type, alliance size, play style
- Comment and discuss approaches
- "Remix" others' strategies with modifications

**Example Content:**
- "Alliance Championship lane distribution for 200M total power alliances"
- "KvK preparation timeline: 30 days out, 2 weeks out, 1 week out, day-of"
- "Territory layout strategies for defensive vs. offensive alliances"
- "Rally timing coordination: How we won Swordland Showdown"

### Privacy & Sharing Controls
**Flexible Visibility:**
- **Private:** Only I can see
- **Alliance Only:** Only my alliance members can see
- **Friends/Followers:** People I've connected with
- **Public:** Anyone on the platform can view
- **Link Sharing:** Generate link to share outside platform

**Why This Matters:**
Some alliances have secret strategies they've developed. Others want to share openly and build reputation. Let users decide what they're comfortable revealing.

### Content Types

**Strategic Planning Posts:**
- Text posts with embedded images/diagrams
- Links to saved schedules, territories, or attack plans
- Video embeds (YouTube tutorials)
- File attachments (spreadsheets, detailed guides)

**Battle Plans (Future - Similar to Territory Planner):**
- Visual KvK attack strategy planner
- Mark castle positions, attack routes, rally points
- Assign specific members to targets
- Timeline view of coordinated strikes
- Share as image or interactive plan
- Comment and suggest modifications

**Discussion Threads:**
- Ask questions and get community input
- "What's the best hero composition for..."
- "How do you handle inactive members during..."
- "Anyone have tips for..."

**Recognition & Milestones:**
- Hit power milestones (10M, 25M, 50M, 100M)
- First T11 troops trained
- Won first Alliance Championship
- Promoted to R4/R5
- Alliance anniversaries

### Moderation & Community Health

**Start Simple:**
- Report button for inappropriate content

- Testing strategies is core gameplay
- Share what worked (and what didn't)
- Iterate based on community feedback
- No single "right" answer

**Quality Over Virality:**
- No algorithmic feed optimizing for engagement
- Chronological + quality sorting (upvotes)
- Emphasize helpful over popular
- No "rage-bait" or controversy farming

**Privacy First:**
- Default to private/alliance-only
- Explicit opt-in for public sharing
- Easy to delete or make private later
- No selling data or targeting ads

**Positive Community:**
- Celebrate success, support learning
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Respectful disagreement expected
- Zero tolerance for toxicity

## Feature Themes (Not Implementation Details)

### Theme 1: Unified Alliance Management
Officers should be able to manage their entire alliance from one platform:
- Who's in the alliance (roster)
- What we're doing (event schedules and plans)
- Who's doing what (assignments and roles)
- How we're performing (participation and progress tracking)
- Communication and coordination

**Key Principle:** Tools that work together are more valuable than isolated utilities.

---

### Theme 2: Multi-Officer Collaboration
Alliance leadership is a team effort. Multiple R4/R5 officers need to:
- View the same member information
- Edit shared schedules and plans
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Track event outcomes together
- Maintain continuity when officers change

**Key Principle:** Collaboration reduces officer burnout and improves outcomes.

---

### Theme 3: Individual Empowerment
Not everyone is an officer, but everyone needs tools:
- Personal calculators and planners
- Strategy guides and information
- Connection to community
- Ability to showcase achievements
- Path to growth and recognition

**Key Principle:** Serve the whole community, not just leaders.

---

### Theme 4: Progressive Disclosure
Start simple, reveal complexity gradually:
- New users get beautiful, functional tools immediately
- No mandatory accounts or overwhelming features
- Power users discover advanced capabilities over time
- Premium features are clearly valuable, not gated basics

**Key Principle:** Easy to start, hard to master, impossible to abandon.

---

### Theme 5: Community & Recognition
Foster connection beyond individual alliances:
- Share successful strategies and templates
- Recognize contributions and achievements
- Create sense of belonging to larger community
- Enable cross-alliance friendships and learning
- Celebrate milestones and accomplishments

**Key Principle:** People stay for the tools, but become advocates for the community.

---

### Theme 6: User-Generated Content & Knowledge Sharing
The platform creator is a player, not an oracle. The best strategies come from the community testing, experimenting, and sharing discoveries:
- Alliance walls where leaders post rules, strategies, announcements
- Player profiles where individuals share their approaches
- Community strategy guides and discussions
- Flexible privacy controls (public, alliance-only, private)
- Comment and discussion on shared content
- Upvoting/rating of helpful strategies

**Key Principle:** We facilitate sharing; the community creates the knowledge. Discovery and experimentation is part of the game's fun—we provide the canvas, players create the art.

---

## Monetization Philosophy

### What Stays Free Forever
- Castle Battle Scheduler
- Territory Planner
- All game calculators
- Basic information and guides
- Tool usage without accounts
- Small alliance roster (up to 50 members)
- Template/example downloads

**Rationale:** Core value must be accessible. Free tier attracts community and proves value.

---

### What Could Be Premium (Future)
**Premium Alliance Workspace** ($5-10/month per alliance):
- Advanced member tracking (participation, progress over time)
- Multi-officer collaboration features
- Alliance-wide messaging/coordination tools
- Event preparation checklists and templates
- Detailed analytics and reports
- Support for 50+ members
- Priority support

**Premium Individual** ($2-5/month per player):
- Personal progression planning tools
- Advanced calculators with save/compare features
- Profile customization (frames, badges)
- Ad-free experience
- Early access to new features

**Rationale:** Those spending thousands on the game will spend $10/month for tools that help them compete. Premium funds ongoing development.

---

### Revenue Allocation (When It Exists)
- 60% - Development and new features
- 20% - Server costs and infrastructure
- 10% - Community rewards and recognition programs
- 10% - Marketing and growth

---

## Guiding Principles

### Build With Users, Not For Them
- Launch features early and iterate based on feedback
- Active Discord/community for input
- Transparent roadmap and development updates
- User testing before major releases

### Quality Over Quantity
- One excellent tool beats five mediocre ones
- Polish existing features before adding new ones
- Performance and mobile experience are critical
- Beauty and usability matter

### Respect Player Time and Money
- No dark patterns or artificial limitations
- Clear, honest monetization
- Free tier is genuinely useful, not a teaser
- Premium features save significant time/effort

### Foster Positive Community
- Celebrate success, don't shame failure
- No pay-to-win leaderboards
- Privacy-first approach to member data
- Inclusive environment for all play styles

### Sustainable Development
- Revenue should fund full-time development eventually
- Open to community contributions (guides, templates, feedback)
- Build for long-term, not quick cash-grab
- Maintain independence from game publisher

---

## Success Metrics (Not Now, But Eventually)

### Community Health
- Monthly active users (alliances and individuals)
- Repeat usage rate (do people come back?)
- Community engagement (Discord, forums, shared content)
- Net Promoter Score (would you recommend this?)

### Product-Market Fit
- Premium conversion rate (free to paid)
- Feature adoption rates
- Support ticket themes (what's confusing?)
- User-requested features (what's missing?)

### Business Sustainability
- Revenue vs. costs
- Development velocity (new features per quarter)
- Retention rate (alliances still active after 3/6/12 months)

---

## What We're NOT Building

**We are NOT:**
- A game cheating tool or exploit
- A replacement for in-game communication
- A data harvesting operation
- A pay-to-win competitive platform
- A social network (though community features exist)
- An official game tool (we're independent/community-driven)

**We are NOT trying to:**
- Replace Discord for alliance communication
- Require players to leave the game to play
- Monetize through ads or selling player data
- Create artificial scarcity to drive payments
- Build features the game publisher should build

---

## Open Questions (To Revisit)

1. **Self-Reporting:** Should individual members be able to log in and update their own stats? Or do officers always maintain the roster manually?
   - *Current thinking:* Officer-managed is simpler to start. Self-reporting adds complexity but reduces officer workload. Revisit after MVP.

2. **Cross-Server Features:** How much should alliances from different servers be able to interact?
   - *Current thinking:* Keep it simple - focus on single-alliance tools first. Cross-server comes later.

3. **Mobile App:** How important is a native mobile app vs. responsive web?
   - *Current thinking:* Responsive web is sufficient for now. Native app only if user demand is overwhelming.

4. **Integration with Game:** Could we integrate with game APIs or screenshot parsing for automatic data import?
   - *Current thinking:* Extremely complex, likely against ToS. Manual entry is fine for now.

5. **Alliance Family Support:** How do we handle mega-alliances that span multiple in-game alliances?
   - *Current thinking:* Not a priority for MVP. Revisit when we have 20+ active premium alliances.

6. **Community Moderation:** As community grows, how do we handle moderation, conflicts, toxicity?
   - *Current thinking:* Cross that bridge when we come to it. Start with basic reporting and manual review.

---

This is a **living vision document**, not a specification:
- Revisit quarterly to assess progress and adjust
- Reference when making feature decisions ("does this align with vision?")
- Share with community to set expectations
- Use to evaluate opportunities and partnerships

**This is NOT:**
- A technical specification (that comes later)
